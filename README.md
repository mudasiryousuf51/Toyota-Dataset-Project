I have developed a complete machine learning pipeline to predict Toyota car resale prices using structured data analytics and statistical modeling. The project includes rigorous data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis to identify the key factors that influence vehicle pricing. I engineered meaningful features, compared multiple regression models, and selected the best-performing approach based on robust evaluation metrics. This work demonstrates end-to-end ML development—from understanding raw data to delivering an accurate, interpretable price-prediction model supported by clear visual insights.
